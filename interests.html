          <h1>Jennifer Huynh's Interests:</h1>
          <p>
              <li>What are your interests and hobbies?
                <p>When I'm not leetcoding or updating my projects, I like to learn about the world by watching documentaries about almost everything and anything on YouTube, update my Spotify playlists of varying genres (including deep house, alternative hip hop, neosoul, indie, and pop), repost motivational quotes and memes (to motivate my family and friends and make them laugh) on Facebook, go hiking, and stare at the sky to look at the stars and predict where the sun and moon will rise and set.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Who do you look up to the most and why?
                <p>I look up to Elon Musk.  Reason being, he looks to provide a better future for society.  Carbon emissions has been one of our greatest environmental issues and Elon has had made great strides at combatting fuel pollution with Tesla.  In addition to that, he has great plans to create a more connected world through technology, such as he did with PayPal and Space X.  Even with the ability to retire comfortably with his riches, it seems as if he's always on a mission to do more for the greater good.</p>
              </li>
              <li>What are you ambitions and goals in life?
                <p>I want to contribute to a better society for humanity.  Other than being kind to others and being a responsible human being, I want to help bring about change by working hard to provide a better foundation for future generations.  I believe that this can be made possible with the combination of discourse between conscientious minds and advancement of technology.</p>
